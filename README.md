# FizzBuzz using TDD in Swift
As apps are becoming more and more popular and something I would like to work with in the future I wanted to understand how you can TDD in Swift. Previously I have made an app but not using the TDD approach so this is the first time usng TDD in Swift.

Yvette, who is a Makers Academy alumi and is a freelane iOS developer has been exploring how to TDD iOS apps using Swift. Using her walkthrough has lead me to produce the popular kids game FizzBuzz, but with a using a fully TDD appraoch in Swift.

#### How Fizzbuzz works
---
You take it in turns to count up to 100(this can be any number you choose, but for this example we will be using 15).

For any number that is divisable by 3 you say 'Fizz',

Any number divisiable by 5 you say 'Buzz',

And any number divisable by both 3 and 5 you say 'Fizzbuzz'.
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz

8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
Fizzbuzz
```
